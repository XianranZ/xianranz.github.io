					<p style="text-align:left;font-size:90%">
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -Design and development of 3D geographic information system platform<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In response to the urgent need for a geospatial platform for multiple projects, a 3D geographic information system display platform was developed based on OpenScencGraph and osgEarth. The total number of lines of code exceeds 10,000, providing functions such as digital earth display, geographic data loading, layer classification control display, static and dynamic image display, and 3D special effect display. All functions provide secondary development services, have good scalabilityand reusability, and have generated great economic value.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -Design and development of 2D and 3D integrated plug-in services<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In order to solve the problem of low efficiency of code sending on the business side, a set of 2D and 3D integrated plug-in services was designed and developed based on QtPlugin and ctk Plugin Framework, which can automatically send the display to the 2D and 3D display platform according to the system operation status by providing an interface to the outside world, thus improving the simplicity and readability of the code sending on the business side and enhancing the flexibility and configurability of the system.<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -Construction and application of geographic information data server<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In response to the low utilization rate of massive geographic data and the continuous increase in transmission costs, a high-performance geographic information data server was built based on GeoServer, Tomcat and Nginx, which can publish vector, raster, elevation and other geographic data 24 hours a day, greatly improving the utilization rate of geographic databases and reducing data transmission costs.<br>

						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -Urban and Thermal Remote Sensing Group, supervised by Professor Wenfeng Zhan<br><br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -With Google Earth Engine (GEE) for computing platform, auxiliary platform based on ArcGIS/Python, <br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  using MODIS temperature/vegetation index/land cover product data, coding to achieve the filter of the<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  world’s 11848 cities/the calculation of urban heat island intensity/ the linear regression between <br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  vegetation index and surface temperature, and on the basis of calculation results, I analyzed the <br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Spatio-temporal Pattern between the urban heat island intensity and surface temperature/vegetation index <br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  of 18 years data in the worldwide, and then I wrote a report, supervised by Professor Wenfeng Zhan of <br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  School of Geographic and Oceanographic Science in Nanjing University.<br><br>

						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -Supervised by Professor Youpeng Xu<br><br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -Water quality data, land use data and socio-economic data were used to calculate the Water Surface Rate,<br>
                        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp	 Water Quality Comprehensive Index and Green Space Coverage Rate, Shannon’s Diversity Index, Growth Rate <br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  of Agricultural and Forestry Output Value and Water Consumption per Ten Thousand yuan of GDP, respectively, <br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  so as to make a comprehensive evaluation of river health in Qinhuai River Basin.<br><br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp -I am responsible for dividing the study area and calculating the Green Space Coverage Rate and Shannon’s Diversity<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp	 Index from the land use data. Firstly, the study area was divided into 10 small watersheds through administrative<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  division boundaries in ArcGIS. Secondly, land use data were overlayed with the divided 10 small watersheds in ArcGIS<br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  to calculate the Green Space Coverage Rate. Finally, fragstats was used to calculate the Shannon’s Diversity Index <br>
						&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  of each watershed
